export let myText: string = "Hello World! I'm coming for the myExports.ts!";
// We create a variable named myText with the type of string and the value of “Hello World!”.
// We put the export statement in front so other ts files can use it.
//
// If you do NOT use the export keyword here the other files can NOT see what was exported.
// So always make sure that if you want other files to access it, that you clearly export it!
