// 1: TEMPLATE LITERALS
//
// Template literals are the same as they are in ES6...just with types!
// Let's do an example:

let myArray: (string | number)[] = ['W', 1, 'u', 2, 'T', 3 , 'a', 4 , 'n', 5 , 'g' ]; //we define a mixed array of numbers and strings here
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(`find the magic word ${myArray[i]} in my array!`); //we console log every element in our array 
};

// sample of the ouput

// find the magic word W in my array!
// find the magic word 1 in my array!
// find the magic word u in my array!
// find the magic word 2 in my array!

// Now let's break down our code:

// We defined our array as a mix of strings and integers, and we explicitly defined that the type of our data must be either a string or number.
// What would happen if we passed a boolean to the array?
// We would get an error because we have a type that is not allowed.

// We call defining MULTIPLE TYPES as a UNION TYPE.

// 2: Destructuring
// 
// When we destructure arrays into separate variables, we can also check to make sure that only specific types are destructured, this avoids type related bugs.

function addition([numOne, numTwo]: [number, number]) { //we define a function which accepts an array with two values, they must be numbers
  let sum: number = numOne + numTwo; //we define sum as the first and second numbers of our array added together, the sum must be a number
  console.log(sum);
};
addition([5, 8]);

//output is 12

// Now let's break down our code:

// We defined a function named addition which destructures an array into numOne and numTwo. We defined the data type as numbers. If either or both of the array values are anything other than numbers, the data is rejected.
// We then define a variable 'sum' to store our result, and we do a final safeguard of defining it as a number as well.

// 3: Spread Operator
//
// A spread operator may seem daunting at first, but it's actually simple once you understand its purpose!
// The spread operator will take an array and expand the data within it to a set of items.
// Taking what you know about TypeScript so far, what would this code return?

// let myArray2: (number)[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 'b']; //we define our array here
// console.log(...myArray); //we have the console print out each element in our array

// What happens in our code?
// That's right! We run into an error! Why? Because our array is supposed to only accept numbers, but we put a string element in it.
// How do we fix it?
// We have to either make sure our dataset only contains numbers or we have to change our array to accept a union type and include strings as an acceptable type.
//Fixed code:

let myArray3: (number | string)[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 'b']; //we define our array here, it now also accepts strings
console.log(...myArray); //we have the console print out each element in our array

// output looks like W 1 u 2 T 3 a 4 n 5 g

// 4: Rest Parameter
//
// What is a rest parameter?

// Let's say we have an array that we need to pass as parameters to a function. This is where rest parameters come in.
// The rest parameter allows us to pass on an indefinite number of parameters into our function. We don't need to know exactly how many elements our array contains, the rest parameter will just keep passing on elements until the array is finished. 

// Taking note of what you read above, what happens when we run this code?

function signIn(signInMessage: string, ...names: string[]) {
  console.log(signInMessage + " " + names.join(", ") + "."); //we define our input types and output here
}

// signIn("Welcome back:", "John", "Steve", "Jane", 1337); //we call our function here, with our values

// How can we fix this?
// The same way we did for the spread operator.
// Fixed Code:

function signIn2(signInMessage: string, ...names: (string | number)[]) {
  console.log(signInMessage + " " + names.join(", ") + "."); //we define our input types here, with our names array now accepting numbers too
}

// signIn("Welcome back:", "John", "Steve", "Jane", 1337); //we call our function here, with our values

// 5: Default Parameters
//
// What are default parameters? 
// Every function parameter expects a value assigned to it, even if the value assigned is null or undefined. With default parameters, we can assign a default value to a parameter if one is not received.
// Let's take a look at an example:

function familyTracker(firstName: string, lastName = "Vaillancourt") { //Here we define a function and say that the first name must be a string, the last name is defaulted to "Smith" if there is no other last name provided
  console.log(`${firstName} is a member of the ${lastName} family.`); //We use a template literal to make a statement
};
familyTracker('Stephane', 'Gambino'); //Expected result: Stephane is a member of the Don family. Due to you setting the second parameter rather than the default
familyTracker('Stephane'); //Expected result: Stephane is a member of the Vallancourt family.

// 6: Classes
//
// What are classes?

// Classes are blueprints by which we can define methods and variables to keep like objects together.
// The best way to learn is by example, so let's dive into a class meant to identify a person.

class Rectangle {

  //Delcare properties
  height: number;
  width: number;

  //Constructor
  constructor(height: number, width: number) { //we specify that height and width are two variables in the class which are both numbers
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }

  //Methods
  get area() {
    return this.calcArea(); //a getter method
  }
  calcArea() {
    return this.height * this.width; //a method to calculate the area of a rectangle
  }
}

let myRectangle = new Rectangle(20, 10); //we make a new rectangle with a height of 20 and a width of 10

console.log(myRectangle.area); //we invoke the getting method, which fetches the area of our rectangle
console.log(myRectangle.height); //we invoke the getting method, which fetches the area of our rectangle
console.log(myRectangle.width); //we invoke the getting method, which fetches the area of our rectangle

// 7: Static Methods
// 
// What are static methods?
// Static methods are usually used to create utility functions for an application. They cannot be called through a class instance.
// Let's take a look at an example of a static method:

class Addition {

  //Properties
  static numOne = 11;
  static numTwo = 2;

  //Methods
  static calcSum() {              // requires teh static keyword
    return this.numOne + this.numTwo; //here we define our static method to add our two variables together
  }
}

console.log(Addition.calcSum()); //we directly call the sum function here because we cannot call it by making an instance of the class (using the new keyword)


// 8: Public/Private

// So now let's introduce the start of the notion of "encapsulation".
// Briefly, as we will cover it in more detail later, there are properties and methods on classes
// that we sometimes do not want anyone to be able to access. We want these to be "hidden" away from
// other users.
// 
// How we can achieve that is through the use of "public" and "private" keywords.
// 
// "Public" means that anyone that has access to an instance of this class can use that property.
// This however puts some data at risk of being used improperly or for bombarding another developer
// with fart oo many options that they don't need to see. 
// 
// Generally speaking, unless you NEED someone to have access towards something, don't let them have access to it.
// User getters/setters if someone needs access to a property. Hide the property itself.
// 

/**
 * Let's take that rectangle class from above you're already familiar with and then add public/private where
 * necessary...
 */

class Rectangle2 {

  //Delcare properties
  private height: number;
  private width: number;

  //Constructor
  public constructor(height: number, width: number) { //we specify that height and width are two variables in the class which are both numbers
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }

  //Methods
  public get area() {
    return this.calcArea(); //a getter method
  }
  public calcArea() {
    return this.height * this.width; //a method to calculate the area of a rectangle
  }
};

const rectObject = new Rectangle2(10, 8);
console.log(rectObject.area) //Try to hit the . operator here and see what you get as options from the drop down...

//Neat, huh? You can't see height or width!!!
//This means that they are removed from your accessibility here! They are PRIVATE.
//On the other hand, area and calc area are PUBLIC and therefore you can access them! Neat, right?

//Let's contrast it to an instance of "Rectangle" (the original one, not this modified one we have here!)

const rectObject2 = new Rectangle(1, 3);
console.log(rectObject2.width); //Now we can access those properties that we made private above...
//BAD! Generally good industry standard is to hide anything you do not need the user to interact with!
//This will come up in a later lecture I do... very VERY VERY VERY important to keep "encapsulation" in mind when making classes!


// 9: Interfaces
// Another concept that is core to TypeScript is interfaces. This will seem similar to objects/classes for now, but there
// are a few key distinctions:
// 
// 1: Unlike a class, you cannot create a new instance of an interface. An interface is not a class. 
// 2: Unlike an object, an interface is not something that you can actually use.
//
// An interface would be closest to think about as an "Explicitly defined type". But that's also not necessarily true but
// if you thought of it along those lines you'd be on the right track.
//
// An interface in reality can be thought of as a "contract" between what you expect and a particular set of data.
//
// If a class IMPLEMENTS an interface, that means that the class guarantees to have the contents of the interface defined
// within the class.
//
// If you have a data type of say a parameter in a function set to the "data type" of an interface, then it is expected
// that anything passed into that function will follow the same structure as the interface defines.


/**
 * This is how you define an interface.
 * Notice the keyword "interface" here and then you have three points 
 * defined as numbers here. 
 * 
 * These aren't explicitly defined with values here, you COULD define a "type literal" here, but an interface
 * is fully intended to not be something that directly holds / manipulates data. It's best thought of as the
 * outline of a contract. A contract that whatever "implements" this interface will follow it.
 */

interface Triangle {    // not be something that directly holds / manipulates data.
  pointA: number,
  pointB: number,
  pointC: number
}

const printTrianglePoints = (trianglePoints: Triangle) => {
  console.log(trianglePoints.pointA, trianglePoints.pointB, trianglePoints.pointC);
  

  //Try retyping that too... notice how nice the autocomplete is? That's awesome.
  //But further from that we formed a contract of what sort of data we expect to be put into here.
  //Again, an interface is not an object holding data. 
  
  //An interface is not a class that can be instantiated into objects.
  //It's more like a contract.
}
